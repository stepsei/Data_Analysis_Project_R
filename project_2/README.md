****** This project experiments on R functions and Shell scripting ******

The reason behind this project are as follows:

--> Writing an R function to calculate Harmonic Mean taking into consideration different scenarios
--> Another R function to calculate Arithmetic Mean for only positive values
--> Combining these two functions into an R script that accepts input from the CLI and process
--> Automating the whole process using a bash script to call these functions
