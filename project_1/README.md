******* An Analysis to Explore Toronto Paramedic Services from the City of Toronto Open Data Project from 2012 - 2016 *******

I'm using my skills in R programming Language and Data Analysis to answer very important questions that might help in understanding the Toronto Paramedic Services and apply to wider set in terms of Paramedic Services.

Some insightful questions we would want to answer are as follows:

--> Total number of incident per incident type
--> Average number of units dispatched 
--> The area with the largest number of incidents 

Note:
Because these files are for different years, I will implore a shell script to be able to read the R scripts and load the csvdata downloaded from the Open Data project. This is to automate the process for future data addition.
